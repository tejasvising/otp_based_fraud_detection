# OTP (One-Time Password) Scam Prevention System

This project aims to protect users from fraudulent activities, such as phishing and unauthorized transactions, by implementing a secure OTP-based validation system. With the integration of **Twilio's Messaging API** and **Firebase Firestore**, OTPs are sent through SMS and verified before any sensitive action, like payment, is processed.
